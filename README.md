# dice-roller

A handy dandy dice roller for tabletop gaming

### Utilizing
- React

### Features
- Create multiple dice at a time
- Create popular sets with one click

### To Do
- Add "Roll all" function
- Figure out the menu's custom input functionality
- Toggle menu when clicking off menu
- Add non-audio feedback on die roll
- Add die themes (D&D, Settlers, classic, etc.)
- Sum roll function (and read out)
- Add sound

### Considerations
- In which component should the side and style information be stored? I moved it from the Die to the App, but I can't remember my reasoning.

### Bugs
- \*crickets\*
